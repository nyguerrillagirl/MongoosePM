# Learning Mongoose

This repository holds the project being developed from the book 
"Mongoose for Application Development".

The books is quite dated (2013) and various things have changed within many of the 
modules used in the MEAN stack. I plan on uploading to this repository (final branch)
the notes I took in developing this project from scratch and the changes I had to make to the code and instructions. 

### What's missing

I do not upload a config.js file that is in the main project folder. The file has the following format:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    'secretKey' : '<MY_SECRET_KEY>',
    'mongoUrl' : '<MONGO_DB_URL>'
}
```

It should be added and populated as suggested in the final notes. 

### This is Chapter02 notes
Establishing a database connection

### Project documentation
Shall be available in the last branch (MONGOOSEPM_11)
